Licenses Considered

1. MIT License: https://mit-license.org/
	The MIT License is a permissive open-source license, granting all users
the right to use, share, modify, and sell any software under the license,
provided the text of the license is provided. The MIT License also permits
derivative works to be released under a different license or made
proprietary (closed-source).

2. Apache License: https://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
	The Apache License v2.0 is a permissive license similar to the MIT license,
providing the same end-user rights and requirements. Additionally, the
Apache License specifies instructions for patenting a modified software under
the Apache License. Additionally, all derived software must list changes made to
the original work.

3. GNU General Public License: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html
	The GPLv3 License is among the most restrictive free software licenses.
As a copyleft license, it grants permissions to use, share, modify,
and sell licenses. However, unlike permissive licenses, it restricts releasing
derivative software under any other license or none at all.

Verdict
	The GPL license is a good choice for protecting intellectual property in free
software from being stolen by corporations. However, it may incompatible when
combined with software under other licenses due to its restrictions.
While Apache and MIT licenses have similar rules, the Apache License also
includes has language regarding to patenting software. Since this program is
an educational demonstration of page tables, a widely-known practice, and
attempts to make no groundbreaking improvements, the MIT License's simple
nature seems the best choice.
