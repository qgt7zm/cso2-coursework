Lab 10: OpenMP

00 (Non-parallel): 2nd Fastest
- No atomic operations, but long loop

11 (Even Split + Atomic): 3rd Slowest
- Only 1 atomic operation for Atomic, but threads need to wait for each other

12 (Even Split + Many-few): Fastest*
- Only 1 atomic operation for Many-few, but threads donâ€™t need to wait for each other to finish

21 (Task Queue + Atomic): Slowest*
- Queue + Atomic both have 1 atomic operation, each, need to wait a lot

22 (Task Queue + Many-few): 2nd Slowest
- Still 2 atomic operations, but nowait means threads can move on early
